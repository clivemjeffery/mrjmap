# Try Phaser for Map Adventure

## Setup

This folder is in a 'tryphaser' root with the Phaser 3 dist files in a 'dist' folder at the same level as itself. I should probably change that to the dist file within the 'phaser' repo that can be cloned there.

It runs on both Windows and macOS with the Mongoose webserver mini-app dropped into the same root.
